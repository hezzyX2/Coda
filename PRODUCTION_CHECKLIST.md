# Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in production environment
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to your domain
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are correct
- [ ] Test build locally: `npm run build && npm start`

### Code Quality
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` - no errors
- [ ] Run `npm run type-check` - no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Test all pages load correctly
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Test premium upgrade flow

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] Login/Signup works
- [ ] Tasks can be created, edited, deleted
- [ ] Journal entries save correctly
- [ ] AI features work (with valid API key)
- [ ] Premium upgrade works
- [ ] Theme switching works
- [ ] All navigation links work
- [ ] Error pages (404, error.tsx) display correctly

### Security
- [ ] Verify API keys are not exposed in client code
- [ ] Check security headers are enabled
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Test authentication redirects work

### Performance
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Bundle size is reasonable
- [ ] Images optimize correctly (if any added)
- [ ] Pages load quickly

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Production ready"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import GitHub repository
3. Add environment variables:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
4. Deploy

### 3. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Visit live site and test all features
- [ ] Verify AI features work with production API key
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test on different browsers
- [ ] Verify error handling works
- [ ] Check console for any errors

## Post-Launch

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Add analytics (Google Analytics, Plausible)
- [ ] Monitor API usage/costs
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring

### SEO
- [ ] Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
- [ ] Verify robots.txt is accessible
- [ ] Check meta tags render correctly
- [ ] Test Open Graph previews

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README with actual domain
- [ ] Document any custom configurations
- [ ] Note any platform-specific settings

## Important Notes

⚠️ **API Key Security**: Never commit `.env.local` to git
⚠️ **Data Persistence**: Current implementation uses localStorage (client-side only)
⚠️ **Premium**: Currently uses localStorage - consider backend for production
⚠️ **Passwords**: Stored in localStorage (not secure for production - use backend)

## Production Recommendations

For a fully production-ready app, consider:
1. **Backend API** for:
   - User authentication (secure password hashing)
   - Data persistence (database)
   - Premium subscription management
   - Payment processing

2. **Database** for:
   - User accounts
   - Tasks, journals
   - Premium subscriptions
   - Analytics

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection prevention (if using SQL)

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Error tracking (Sentry)
   - Analytics
   - Uptime monitoring
   - API usage tracking

Your app is ready to deploy as-is for a working prototype/MVP!
