# ✅ User Data Persistence - How It Works

## 🎯 Overview

**Every user's data is now saved separately and persists across sessions!**

When users sign up or log in, their data (tasks, journal entries, preferences) is:
- ✅ **Saved per user** - Each user has their own separate data
- ✅ **Persists across sessions** - Data is saved and loaded when they log back in
- ✅ **Isolated** - Users cannot see each other's data
- ✅ **Automatic** - No manual save needed, data saves automatically

---

## 🔐 How Data is Stored

### User-Specific Storage Keys

Instead of global storage, data is now stored with user-specific keys:

**Format:** `coda.tasks.{userEmail}`

**Example:**
- User `john@example.com` → `coda.tasks.john_example_com`
- User `sarah@university.edu` → `coda.tasks.sarah_university_edu`

This ensures:
- ✅ Each user's data is separate
- ✅ Data persists when user logs back in
- ✅ Multiple users on same device have separate data

---

## 📊 What Data is Saved Per User

### 1. **Tasks**
- All tasks created by the user
- Task status (completed/pending)
- Due dates, difficulty levels
- Time estimates

**Storage Key:** `coda.tasks.{userEmail}`

### 2. **Journal Entries**
- All journal entries written
- Entry dates and prompts
- Entry text content

**Storage Key:** `coda.journal.{userEmail}`

### 3. **Preferences**
- Theme selection
- Focus block duration
- Break duration
- Difficulty bias
- AI tone preference

**Storage Key:** `coda.prefs.{userEmail}`

### 4. **User Account**
- Email, name
- Premium status
- Subscription info
- Account creation date

**Storage:** `coda.users.v1` (shared list) + `coda.auth.v1` (current session)

## 🔄 Login/Logout Flow

### **Sign Up:**
1. User enters email, password, name
2. Account is created
3. User-specific storage keys initialized
4. Old global data migrated to user account (if exists)
5. User automatically logged in

### **Log In:**
1. User enters email and password
2. Account verified
3. User session activated
4. **User's data automatically loads** from their specific storage
5. Old global data migrated (if exists, one-time)

### **Using the App:**
1. User creates tasks, writes journals, changes preferences
2. **Data automatically saves** to user-specific storage
3. All changes persist immediately

### **Log Out:**
1. Current session cleared
2. User redirected to login
3. User's data remains saved (for next login)

### **Log Back In:**
1. User enters credentials
2. User session activated
3. **All their previous data automatically loads:**
   - ✅ All their tasks
   - ✅ All their journal entries
   - ✅ Their preferences and settings
   - ✅ Their premium status

## 🔒 Data Security & Isolation

### **User Data Isolation:**
- ✅ Each user's data is completely separate
- ✅ User A cannot see User B's tasks or journals
- ✅ Even on the same device/browser, users have separate data
- ✅ Data is keyed by email address (sanitized)

### **Browser Storage:**
- Data is stored in browser's `localStorage`
- Persists across browser sessions
- Cleared only if:
  - User clears browser data
  - User logs out and clears storage manually
  - Browser data is cleared

### **Multi-Device:**
- ⚠️ **Note:** localStorage is per-device
- Data on Device A is separate from Device B
- For cloud sync, would need backend database (future enhancement)

## 🔄 Data Migration

### **Automatic Migration:**
When a user logs in, the system automatically:
1. Checks for old global data (`coda.tasks.v1`, etc.)
2. If old data exists and user has no data yet:
   - Migrates old data to user-specific storage
   - Only happens once per user
3. Old global data remains (not deleted) for safety

### **Migration Safety:**
- ✅ Only migrates if user has no existing data
- ✅ Doesn't overwrite user's existing data
- ✅ One-time migration per user
- ✅ Old data preserved (backup)

---

## ✅ Verification

### **How to Test:**

1. **Sign up** with email: `test@example.com`
2. **Create some tasks** and journal entries
3. **Log out**
4. **Log back in** with same email
5. **Verify** all your tasks and journal entries are still there ✅

### **Test Multiple Users:**

1. **Sign up** as `user1@test.com`, create tasks
2. **Log out**
3. **Sign up** as `user2@test.com`
4. **Verify** user2 sees empty tasks (not user1's data) ✅
5. **Log out**, log in as `user1@test.com`
6. **Verify** user1's data is still there ✅

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

For production scale, consider:
- **Backend Database** (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- **Cloud Sync** across devices
- **Backup & Restore** functionality
- **Data Export** for users
- **Account Deletion** with data cleanup

---

**Your app now properly saves and loads user data! 🎉**
