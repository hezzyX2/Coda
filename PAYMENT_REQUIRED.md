# ✅ Payment Required - No Free Upgrades

## 🔒 Security Implemented

**✅ All users must pay for Premium** - No exceptions!

### What Was Changed:
- ❌ **Removed** free upgrade fallback
- ✅ **Payment required** through Stripe only
- ✅ **Error message** shown if Stripe not configured
- ✅ **No bypass** - everyone pays $9.99/month

### How It Works:
1. User clicks "Upgrade Now"
2. **Must** go through Stripe Checkout
3. **Must** complete payment
4. **Only then** gets Premium access
5. Webhook confirms payment and activates Premium

## ⚠️ Important for Production

**Webhook Must Be Configured:**
- Without webhook, users won't get Premium even after payment
- Webhook activates Premium status after successful payment
- See `STRIPE_SETUP.md` for webhook configuration

**Testing:**
- Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Verify payment in Stripe Dashboard
- Check webhook fires and activates Premium

**Your app is secure - everyone must pay! 💰**
