# Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Deploy App â†’ Get Public URL â†’ Setup Stripe

**Order:** GitHub â†’ Deploy â†’ Stripe Setup

---

## Step 1: Set Up GitHub (Source Control)

### 1.1 Create GitHub Account (if needed)
- Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up

### 1.2 Create New Repository
1. Click "+" in top right â†’ "New repository"
2. Name: `coda-app` (or any name)
3. Description: "AI-powered student organizer"
4. Set to **Private** (recommended) or Public
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 1.3 Push Your Code to GitHub

Open terminal in your project folder and run:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd "/Users/ryanpolicicchio/Coda Website V1"

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - Coda app ready for deployment"

# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/coda-app.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** You'll be asked for GitHub username and password. Use a **Personal Access Token** instead of password:
- Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
- Generate new token (classic) with `repo` permission
- Use that as password

3. Vercel will auto-detect it's a Next.js app
4. Click "Deploy" (don't change settings yet)

### 2.3 First Deployment
- Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete
- You'll get a URL like: `https://coda-app-xyz.vercel.app`

### 2.4 Add Environment Variables
1. Go to your project in Vercel
2. Click **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
